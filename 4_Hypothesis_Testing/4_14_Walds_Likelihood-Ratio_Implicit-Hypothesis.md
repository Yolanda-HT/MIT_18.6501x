## Wald's Test, Likelihood Ratio Test, and Implicit Hypothesis Test

## Objectives

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to do the following:

- Derive Wald's test using the properties of multivariate Gaussians.

- Perform Wald's test for a family of hypothesis testing questions.

- Perform the likelihood ratio test for a family of hypothesis testing questions.

- Use an asymptotically normal estimator to test implicit hypotheses involving an unknown parameter.
