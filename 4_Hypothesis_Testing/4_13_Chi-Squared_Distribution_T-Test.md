## Parametric Hypothesis Testing, Finite Sample Sizes, and Chi-Squared and Student's T Distributions

## Objectives


At the end of this lecture, you will be able to do the following

- Test hypotheses when the i.i.d. data samples have a Gaussian distribution.

- Recognize when you cannot assume the test statistic to be approximately Gaussian (in the small sample sizes regime).

- Understand, recognize, and use the Chi-Squared Distribution .

- Use the Cochran's Theorem , which relates the sample variance and sample mean when the data samples are i.i.d. Gaussian.

- Understand, recognize, and use the Student's T Distribution ; understand when the test statistic follows a Student's t distribution in finite samples.

- Test hypotheses in the small sample sizes regime when the i.i.d. data samples have a Gaussian distribution.

- Understand convergence of the Student's t distribution to the standard normal distribution as the sample size increases.

- The Unit 4 slides below, which are for the next 4 lectures , are also available in the resource tab at the top of this course site.
