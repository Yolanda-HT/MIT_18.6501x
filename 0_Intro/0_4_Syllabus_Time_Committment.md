## Syllabus

Tuesday due dates; Wednesday release dates:

The due dates are WEEKLY on Tuesdays , and the release dates of the lecture exercises and homework due are two Wednesdays before that.

Exams due on Mondays

The only exception to the due dates are the two midterm and final exams, which are due on Mondays .

Time Committment:

The corresponding on-campus class is designed so that MIT students with appropriate prerequisites in mathematics spend on average 12 hours per week on lectures, recitations, readings, and homework. You should expect a comparable effort, or more if you need to catch up on background material.

In a typical week, there will be roughly 3 hours of lecture clips, but it might take you 5-7 hours when you add the time spent on exercises. Plan to spend another 1-2 hours watching recitations. Finally, expect about 5-7 hours spent on the weekly problem sets.
