## Introduction

Welcome to 18.6501x Fundamentals of Statistics. This mathematics course offers an introduction to the theoretical foundations of statistical methods that are useful in many applications. The goal is to understand the role of mathematics in the research and development of efficient statistical methods. At the end of this class, you will be able to do the following:

- From a real-life situation, formulate a statistical problem in mathematical terms;

- Understand the role of mathematics in the design and analysis of statistical methods;

- Select appropriate statistical methods;

- Understand the implications and limitations of various methods.

You will expand your statistical knowledge to not only include a list of methods, but also the mathematical principles that link these methods together, equipping you with the tools you need to develop new ones.
