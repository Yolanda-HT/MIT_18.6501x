## Grading policy

Your overall score in this class will be a weighted average of your scores for the different components, with the following weights:

- 20% for the lecture exercises (divided equally among the 19 out of 22 lectures)
- 20% for the homeworks (divided equally among 10 (out of 12) homeworks)
- 18% for the first midterm exam (timed)
- 18% for the second midterm exam (timed)
- 24% for the final exam (timed)

To earn a verified certificate for this course, you will need to obtain an overall score of 60% or more of the maximum possible overall score.

Lecture Exercises and Problem Sets

The lowest 3 scores among the 22 lectures will be dropped, so only 19 out of 22 lectures will count . The lowest 2 scores among the 12 homeworks will be dropped, so only 10 out of 12 homeworks will count .

This policy is to accommodate for scheduling conflict, illness, or events which might deter you from completing the work before the deadline with the best grades you can. However, we still fully expect you to learn the material for any dropped assignments, and the exams will cover everything.

Note that not every homework or set of lecture exercises will have the same number of raw points. For example, homework 0 may have 53 points and homework 1 may have 43 points. However, each one receives the same weight for the purposes of calculating your overall score.

As an illustrative example, if you receive 40 points out of 53 on Homework 0, this will contribute 4053⋅20%10≈1.51% to your overall score. Similarly, if you receive 40 points out of 43 on Problem Set 2, this will contribute 4043⋅20%10≈1.86% to your overall score.

Under the “Progress" tab at the top, you can see your score broken down for each assignment, as well as a summary plot.

Verified/Audit Access : Audit and verified learners will both have access to all learning materials, including all lecture videos and exercises, recitations, and homeworks.

However, the exams are for assessment and reserved to those interested into pursuing a certificate or the Micromasters credential. Hence, midterm 2 and the final exam, which are after the upgrade deadine, are restricted to verified learners only .

Timed Exams

The 2 midterm exams and one final exam are timed exams . This means that each exam is available for approximately a week, but once you open the exam, there is a limited amount of time (48 hours), counting from when you start, within which you must complete the exam. Please plan in advance for the exams. If you do not complete the whole exam during the allowed time, you will miss the points associated with the questions that have not been answered. The exams are designed to assess your knowledge. There are no extensions granted to these deadlines. You can find the exam dates on the calendar on the previous page.

Warning: Note that the timed exams CANNOT be completed using the edX mobile app.

MITx Committment to Accessibility

Requests are reviewed via an interactive process to meet accessibility requirements for learners with disabilities and uphold the academic integrity for MITx.
