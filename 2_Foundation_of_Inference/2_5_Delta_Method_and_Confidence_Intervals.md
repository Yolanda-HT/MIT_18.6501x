## Objectives
At the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- Apply the **Delta method** to an asymptotically normal sequence of random variables.
- Estimate the parameter and construct **confidence intervals for an exponential statistical model** using the Delta method.
- Construct confidence intervals for a variety of statistical models using the Delta method and one of the **conservative** , **solve** , or **plug-in** methods.
- Give a **frequentist interpretation** of the meaning of a (asymptotic) confidence interval of level 1‚àíùõº.
