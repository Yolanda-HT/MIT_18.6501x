## Objectives
At the end of this lecture, you will be able to do the following:

- Understand and identify link functions for generalized linear models .

- Understand and identify the canonical link function for a given exponential family.

- Find the maximum likelihood estimate for a generalized linear model with a canonical exponential family.

- Understand the strict concavity of the log-likelihood when the link function is the canonical link function.

- Understand that asymptotic normality holds for GLMs under usual conditions for asymptotic normality of the MLE.
