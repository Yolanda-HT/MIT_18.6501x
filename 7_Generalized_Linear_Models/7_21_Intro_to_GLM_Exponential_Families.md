## Objectives

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to

- Recognize the two components, namely the noise distribution and the regression function , being generalized from linear models to form the generalized linear models .

- Define appropriate link functions for a generalized linear model.

- Define k-parameter exponential families of distributions.

- Define canonical exponential families of distributions.

- Compute the mean and variance of canonical exponential families in term of the log-partition function .
