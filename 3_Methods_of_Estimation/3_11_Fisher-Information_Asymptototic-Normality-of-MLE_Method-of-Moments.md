## Objectives
At the end of this lecture, you will be able to do the following:

- Compute the Fisher information of a statistical model.

- Compute the asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimator.

- Use the method of moments to estimate parameters in a statistical model.

- Describe conditions under which the method of moments succeeds.

- Use the delta method to compute the asymptotic variance of the method of moments estimator.

- Compare and contrast the maximum likelihood estimator and the method of moments .
