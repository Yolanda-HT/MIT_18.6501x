## Objectives

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to do the following:

- Derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the uniform statistical model and prove its consistency.

- Recognize that the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent.

- Know that independence implies zero covariance but not vice-versa.

- Define sample covariance as an unbiased estimator for the covariance.

- Obtain the covariance matrix of a random vector.

- Identify multivariate Gaussian random variables and understand affine transformations of multivariate Gaussian random variables.

- Use multivariate Central Limit Theorem .

- Use multivariate Delta method .
