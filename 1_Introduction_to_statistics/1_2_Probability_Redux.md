## Objectives

- Recall the statements of the **(strong/weak) law of large numbers** and the **central limit theorem** and know to apply these for large sample sizes.

- Apply **Hoeffding's inequality** to the sample means of bounded i.i.d. random variables.

- Recall the probability density function and properties of the **Gaussian distribution** .

- Use **Gaussian probability tables** to obtain probabilities and **quantiles** .

- Distinguish between **convergence almost surely** , **convergence in probability** and **convergence in distribution** , understand that these notions are from strongest to weakest.

- Determine convergence of sums and products of sequences that converge almost surely or in probability.

- Apply **Slutsky's theorem** to the sum and product of a sequence that converges in distribution and another that converges in probability to a constant.

- Use the **continuous mapping theorem** to determine convergence of sequences of a function of random variables.
