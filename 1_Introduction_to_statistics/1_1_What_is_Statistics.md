## Goals of the class
Goals of the class
Welcome to 18.6501x! This class offers an in-depth introduction to the theoretical foundations of statistical methods that are useful in many applications. The goal is to understand the role of mathematics in the research and development of efficient statistical methods.

At the end of this class, you will be able to

- From a real-life situation, formulate a statistical problem in mathematical terms ;
- Understand the role of mathematics in the design and analysis of statistical methods;
- Select appropriate statistical methods for your problem;
- Understand the implications and limitations of various methods .

Text book recommendation: This course does not follow a textbook, but a good reference is All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, by Larry Wasserman.

## Concepts: Statistics, Data Science, Machine Learning, AI
Similarities & Differences
- All use data to gather insight and ultimately make decisions
- Statistics is at the core of the data processing part
- Nowadays, computational aspects play an important role as data becomes larger
View points:
- Computational view: data is a (large) sequence of numbers that needs to be processed by a relatively fast algorithm: approximate nearest neighbors, low dimensional embeddings, spectral methods, distributed optimization, etc.
- Statistical view: data comes from a random process. The goal is to learn how this process works in order to make predictions or to understand what plays a role in it.
*To understand randomness, we need Probability*

## Statistics and Modeling

- **Probability**: deduce probability of outcomes
- **Statistics**: estimate parameters from data
- **Statistical Modeling**: sometimes deterministic but too complex phenomenon
*Complicated process = Simple process + random noise*
*(good) Modeling consists in chooseing (plausible) simple process and noise distribution*
