## Objectives
At the end of this lecture, you will be able to

- Write down the multivariate linear regression model .

- Compute the distribution of the least square estimator (LSE) for linear regression with deterministic design .

- Know that in the setting of deterministic design, the least square estimator is the maximum likelihood estimator.

- Compute the quadratic risk and prediction error of the LSE.

- Perform hypothesis test for linear regression models.

- Design Bonferroni's tests for testing multiple hypotheses.


## Multivariate Linear Regression

#### When feature number > observations (high dimensional statistics)
- Ridge regression (add identity matrix to observation to make it invertible)
- Lasso estimator

#### Homoscedasticity

In statistics, a sequence (or a vector) of random variables is homoscedastic(ˌhoʊmoʊskəˈdæstɪk) if all its random variables have the same finite variance. This is also known as homogeneity of variance. The complementary notion is called heteroscedasticity. The spellings homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity are also frequently used.
